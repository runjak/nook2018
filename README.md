The [nook2018](https://metanook.de/2018) will happen on 2018-10-03.
A german version of the cfp can be found [here](https://metanook.de/2018/cfp).

There are three places where you can run `yarn install` or `npm install`:
1. `src/server/`
2. `src/client/`
3. `slides/`

All of these paces also support a `start` command. Use `yarn start` or `npm run start` for fun and profit.
