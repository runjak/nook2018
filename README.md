===

The [nook2018](https://metanook.de/2018) will happen on 2018-11-09.
A german version of the cfp can be found [here](https://metanook.de/2018/cfp).

There are three places where you can run `yarn install` or `npm install`:

1. `src/server/`
2. `src/client/`
3. `slides/`

All of these places also support a `start` command. Use `yarn start` or `npm start` for fun and profit.

Tested with node versions `10.13.0` and `11.1.0` - so as long as you either have LTS or current (2018-11-08) you should be fine.

2. Entering the `slides/` directory.
3. Executing `npm install` or `yarn install` in there.
4. Using `yarn start` or `npm start` for a live preview of the slides.
5. Using `yarn build` or `npm build` to generate static html pages.
